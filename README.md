# House Prices Germany
  
This Project tries to predict the prices for houses for sale on the german real estate market.  
For that, i scraped data from roughly 30000 house-for-sale offers from the real estate website [immowelt.de](https://www.immowelt.de/).

## The actual code, you'll find in the notebooks 

  [__House Price Predicitons.ipynb__](https://github.com/mmrachacz/final_project/blob/main/House%20Price%20Predicitons-%20FINAL.ipynb)   
  - contains the cleaning and prediction process
